# Machine Learning Algorithms 🤖📚

Welcome to my **Machine Learning Algorithms** repository! 🚀

This repository is dedicated to collecting and organizing implementations of various Machine Learning algorithms that I am currently learning and experimenting with. Whether it's classic algorithms like Linear Regression and Decision Trees, or more advanced ones like Support Vector Machines and Neural Networks, you'll find their code here.

## Why this repo?
Machine Learning is a vast field, and learning by coding is one of the best ways to understand the concepts deeply. This repo serves as both my personal notebook and a resource for anyone interested in exploring ML algorithms through hands-on practice.

## What’s coming next?
As I continue my learning journey, I will keep adding:
- New algorithms and models 🌟
- Optimizations and improvements on existing code ⚙️
- Real-world datasets to test the algorithms 📊

Feel free to check back regularly or even contribute if you want!
